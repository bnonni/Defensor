## Defensor

Description & Purpose:
  * Defensor is an Instrusion Detection System to identify threats on a user's network and protect their computer
  * The app/service analyzes network packets, uses Machine Learning to identify and thwart threats and create security policies to prevent future attacks

Technical Specifications:
  * Frontend: Electron
  * Backend: MongoDB
  * ML Models: K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks
  * Language: Node, JSON, Python
  * Packages: Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Ski-kit Learn, Matplotlib

Main Functional Specifications:
  * Filter all network packets
  * Store network packets in database
  * Detect anomalies, identify threats, stop attacks and create preventative security policies
  * Backpropogate new anomalies to model for nearest neighbor classification resulting in "best policy" adaptation
  * Refeed new anomalies to model to create new security policies

## Defensor: Defending you against threats unknown.
